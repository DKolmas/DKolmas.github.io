Hi, my name is Damian Kolmas.
I have created this website so I could store my Machine Learninig notes. I want also to share my notes with others, especially those who start they journey with Machine Learning topic.

I ma very much interested in Machine Learning, drones (autonomous control applications) and finally I am big fan of Internet of Things (IoT) and in particular smart cities concept.

If you have comments or questions please let me know (via LI).

Have a look on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-kolmas-1833334/) profile.
