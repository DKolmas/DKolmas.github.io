Hi, my name is Damian Kolmas.
I have created this website so I could keep up with my notes mainly in Machine Learninig topic. In addition I want to share my notes with others.

I ma very much interested in Machine Learning, drones (software and applications) and finally I am big fan of smart cities concept (Internet of Things).

On the private site I would love to spend more time sailing and hiking :)

Have a look on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-kolmas-1833334/) profile.
