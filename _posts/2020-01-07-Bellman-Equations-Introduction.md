### What you can find in this note?
1. What is Bellman equation?
2. What Bellman equation brings to us?

### What Bellman equation gives to us?

Bellman equation helps us to formialize connection between value of current state and value of following state without the need for waiting to observe all the futture rewards.
In other words Bellman equstion relates current and future values.
