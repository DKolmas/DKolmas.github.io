### What is reward and return?

In reinforcement learning framework, at each time step $$t$$ agent takes action and **environment responses back with special signal called reward** $$R_t\in\mathbb{R}$$. A reward is a simple number (value). Informally, the goal of the agent is to maximize the total amount of rewards it receives from the environment. Therefore it is not important to maximize imeediate reward but total sum of all rewards (cumulative reward) over long run. This concept can be stated in a followed way as **reward hypothesis**:

That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought as a **maximization of the expected value** of the cumulatvie sum of received scalar signals (called reward).
