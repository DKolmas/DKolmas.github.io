Marcov Decission Process topic I will cover in the next note or notes.

There are many other topics I am working curently with. However, putting them in the form of note (post) takes time and I am not prioritizing it now.

K-armed badit problem is already covered in the following [bandit problem](http://www.damiankolmas.com/rl/Bandit-problem/) note.
