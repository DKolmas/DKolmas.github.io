So far I have covered following topics:
 * K-armed bandit problem (bandits problem). I have epxplained what is bandit problem and why it matters on the way to Reinforcement Learning. See [Bandit Problem](http://www.damiankolmas.com/rl/Bandit-problem/) note.
 * How action value can be used in general. This topic is covered in [Action Value - An Overivew](http://www.damiankolmas.com/rl/Action-value-method/) note
 * How action value can be estiamted. This topic is covered in [Estimating Value of Action](http://www.damiankolmas.com/rl/Estimating-value-of-action/#) note.


Next I will focus on following topics:
 * Marcov Decission Process - the way to represent (dynamics of) environment
 * Bellman Equations
 * Dynamic Programming - a family of algorithms desing with assumption of full knowledge of the environment (MDP is priveded)

Other topics are on the way as well...
